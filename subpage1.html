        <p class="F1p">Formula 1 is considered by many the pinicle of motorsport. I has the fastest cars, and 20 of the world's best drivers.
            Every year they go head to head too which one is faster, and which team managed to make the fastest car.
            for the last 4 years, that person has been Max Verstappen and RedBull, but in 2025 a new challenger has emmerged: McLaren.
            The team, toghther with it's 2 top drivers: Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, hope that this year is the year they
            take the fight to the reigning world chapmions.</p>

    <h1>Max Verstappen: G.O.A.T.?</h1>

        <img style="order: 2; border-radius: 8px;"class="max"src="https://frontstretch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canada-F1-Max-Verstappen-woohoo-Jared-C-Tilton-Getty-Images-Red-Bull-Content-Pool.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen">
       
        <p class="F1p" style="order: 1;">The GOAT debate in Formula 1 is very serious. Most of the time the conversation is around 2 drivers: Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton. 
            Both drivers have 7 world championships, and both have been the fastest driver in the sport for a long time, lewis Hamilton holding the record for most wins in F1.
            Despite all of this, there is a new contender for the title of GOAT: Max Verstappen. The dutch driver has been dominating the sport for the last 4 years, and is on track to break all records.
